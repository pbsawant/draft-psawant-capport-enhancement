1.  Introduction

   As described in [RFC8908], the Captive Portal API data structure is
   specified in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) [RFC8259].  Requests
   and responses for the Captive Portal API use the "application/
   captive+json" media type.  The original specification specifies key
   "user-portal-url" to convey the web portal URL to the client.
   Although in most cases client devices are capable of presenting the
   web portal to the user, there are types of devices that are not built
   to support the user interaction with the web portal.  This document
   specifies a new key that allows client to perform the authentication
   without user interaction.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  API State Structure Enhancement

   Table 1 shows the new key that can be optionally included in the top-
   level of the JSON structure returned by the API server.
